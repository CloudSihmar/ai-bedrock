I purchased this phone with high hopes, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a complete disappointment. Within just a few weeks of use, the phone started experiencing serious issues. The screen suddenly cracked without any impact or mishandling from my side, and the phone became unusable. I tried contacting customer support, but their response was slow and unhelpful. I had to spend a significant amount to get the phone repaired, which was frustrating. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of this phone and would not recommend it to anyone
